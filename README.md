# 👋 Hello! I'm Monica - Aspiring Software Engineer

I am a final-year Computer Engineering student specializing in **Software Engineering**, set to graduate this June. My academic journey has provided me with a strong foundational knowledge in computer science principles, complemented by intense project-based learning.

I also studied at **42 Barcelona**, where I developed skills in collaborative problem-solving, efficient C programming, and complex systems architecture through peer-to-peer evaluation. The project-based environment strengthened my autonomy and ability to tackle demanding technical challenges.
